Businesses must stay afloat, so are allowed to borrow money from banks with government guarantees. If these loans are not paid back, the government is liable for the debt. How are businesses ever expected to pay back the loans with new lockdowns every few months? This looks increasingly like bankbruptcy by design. If a country becomes indebted they will eventually lose their state assets like public utility companies, natural resources and ultimately it's soverignty. Essentially all countries await the same fate as famously bankrupt countries Greece, Argentina etc.",
