  "Conclusion": "- Philanthropist-Investor extraordinaire Bill Gates and other smarter and less visible globalists are funding the WHO and at the same time investing in Big Pharma and vaccines.\r\n- The WHO is then declaring dubious pandemics with wildly different outcomes. From the barely noticable swine flu of 2010 to the unprecedented Covid19 that has shifted the entire world to a technocratic dystopia.\r\n- As a result the philanthropist-investors are making a killing and the pandemic has resulted in the biggest wealth shift in history.",
