  "Conclusion": "- Developing countries have borrowed money en mass from the IMF and World Bank.\r\n- Advanced countries have outlawed their real economy and replaced it with a Covid Economy.\r\n- Media organizations, journalists get free money to inform the public on how to stay safe during the pandemic.\r\n- Hospitals and health care practitioners are on the frontline of receiving extra funding.\r\n- Everyone and their dog is in someway benefiting from the neverending cash that flows from the top down.\r\n- Perpetual lockdowns seem to have changed the world's economy in an irreversible way, en route to a Great Reset.\r\n- KLAUS SCHWAB of the World Economic Forum seems to believe he is our daddy. Lock us down us harder daddy.",
