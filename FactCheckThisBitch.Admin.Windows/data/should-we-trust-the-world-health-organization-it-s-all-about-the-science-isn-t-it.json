        "Thesis": "So according to WHO, there was a swine flu H1N1 pandemic that came and went in 2009-2010 and the world barely noticed. But the Covid 19 pandemic was such a threat for humanity that the whole world had to descent to totallitarianism within two years. How are these both a \"pandemic\" if the response was so vastly different. Could the previous pandemics have been a dry run for a world take over by globalists?",
