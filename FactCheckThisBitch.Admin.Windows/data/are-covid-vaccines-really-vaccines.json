Begs the question, are vaccine takers Genetically Modified Organisms?\r\n- Big Pharma would be liable for injuries had their product not been labeled \"vaccines\", but now it's the taxpayer picking up the bill.\r\n- Big Pharma is regularly paying huge fines for other nefarious practices.\r\n- Goverment bodies such as the US Food and drug administration seem to have Big Pharma's back.",

          "Summary": "A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease.[1] A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future. Vaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer).[2][3][4][5] Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented completely.[6]",
