Introduction

The project NetworkOperations is a console application that runs various HTTP requests. It could be extended to implement an
entire protocol etc. 

The project draft/BrowserUtil is related as it's supposed to mimic visiting a website with a WebBrowser control. 
It doesn't work inside a default linux docker container unfortunately because it uses Win libraries.

The project DockerVpnOrchestrator is a console application that uses the NetworkOperations and the NordVpn docker image https://github.com/bubuntux/nordvpn.
It runs multiple Vpn docker containers that each provide a vpn network with a unique Ip.
For each one it runs a NetworkOperations instance inside a separate docker container, that utilizes the vpn network.
So the end result is you run the same network commands simultaneously via different Ip for every instance.

Commands:

# build NetworkOperations docker image. Only repeat if code has changed
docker build -t networkOperations .


# run NordVpn container
# dun networkPoc docker container, using NordVpn docker container https://github.com/bubuntux/nordvpn

docker run -ti --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name vpn -e USER=tkandiliotis@gmail.com -e PASS=NordVpn123 -e TECHNOLOGY=NordLynx -d ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordvpn
docker run -it --net=container:vpn --name networkOperations networkOperations

(wait for console app to finish before next commands)
# stop & remove containers

docker stop dockernetworkpoc
docker rm -v dockernetworkpoc
docker stop vpn
docker rm -v vpn
