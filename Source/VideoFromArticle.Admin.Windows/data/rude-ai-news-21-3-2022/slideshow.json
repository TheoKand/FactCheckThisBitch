      "Narration": "The Miami Standard News Reports:\r\n\r\nSenator William Smith has proposed new legislation in Maryland that would legalize “abortion” up to 28 days after a child is born.\r\n\r\nSenate Bill 669, also called the “Pregnant Person’s Freedom Act of 2022,” provisions that a newborn baby can be left to die for up to a month after being born in the event that the “mother” decides she no longer wants to keep it.\r\n\r\nA hearing for the “woke” bill has been scheduled for March 15 when legislators will debate it.\r\n\r\n“The bill also proposes a revision of the fetal murder manslaughter statute that would serve to handcuff the investigation of infant deaths unrelated to abortion,” American Center for Law and Justice attorney Olivia Summers pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this has to do with wording in the legislation that would prohibit investigations into and criminal prosecutions of women and medical professionals for “failure to act” in relation to a “perinatal death.”\r\n\r\n“In other words, a baby born alive and well could be abandoned and left to starve or freeze to death,” Summers said. “And nothing could be done to punish those who participated in that cruel death.”\r\n\r\nThe language of the legislation, Summers warned, is so unclear that it would, in fact, “prevent investigations into the death of infants at least seven days AFTER their birth, and may extend to infants as old as four weeks.”",

      "Narration": "The president of Ukraine seems to be trying his best to give credit to the Russian narrative about fighting Nazis in Ukraine. The Spanish newspaper MARCA reports:\r\n\r\nVolodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, has been seen in various TV appearances since Russia's military operation began, wearing military clothing, despite not participating in combat himself.\r\n\r\nHowever, in recent days, he has added a cross to his outfit that has sparked all kinds of speculation.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely during his speech at the United States Congress in which he imperatively demanded more military aid from the West when this cross symbol was first seen, with some believing it was a Nazi symbol.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it was an Iron Cross with the coat of arms of Ukraine in the center, an insignia of the Armed Forces of Ukraine made up of the Ground Forces, the Air Force, the Navy, the Air Assault Forces and the Special Operations Forces.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore said to not be a nod to any Nazi symbology, even though Adolf Hitler appropriated the Iron Cross when he added a swastika to it in the centre during World War II.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ukraine does have a strong far-right and neo-Nazi influence at the heart of its command, with the Western-funded Azov Battalion and S14 group openly following Nazi ideology.",

      "Narration": "A battled hardened US war correspondent seems to be going against the mainstream media narrative, about what is actually happening in Ukraine. The Daily koch reports:\r\n\r\nEd Henry of Real America's Voice's interviewed Lara Logan. The subject was Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Fifteen years ago Logan, then a war correspondent with a glittering reputation, would have provided a cogent and incisive analysis. But it is not fifteen years ago. And Logan is not that person anymore. It is fair to say that she has gone nuts. Let her own words provide it.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry suggested that Putin had overestimated his military and underestimated Ukrainian resolve, Logan’s answer started with fingernails and headed to white supremacy.   \r\n\r\nQuote\r\n“I have never seen people with their nails done in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. I mean, we're being corralled into this box where we either have to hate the Vladimir Putin and believe everything evil that's said about him, and love Ukraine, and there's no in between. And that reminds me a lot of you're either, you know, a white supremacist or you go with the Democrat narrative on everything under the sun. Vladimir Putin knew exactly what he was doing when he went into Ukraine. Russia is not struggling. What Russia has done from the very beginning has been very strategic. They didn't go straight to Kyiv. They went to all those bioweapons laboratories that are scattered all over the country. Some of them they built. So they know where they are. They've known where they are since the Soviet Union, because under the defense threat reduction program, we went in after the fall of the Soviet Union, and supposedly they turned those facilities from bioweapons labs into public health labs. Although, you know, these days, it's hard to believe anything that our leaders tell us because they've lied about COVID. They lied about Russia collusion. They lied about the Ukraine impeachment trial. You see dishonesty when it comes to the Azov Battalion, which is funded by the US and NATO. I mean, you can find pictures of them online holding up the NATO flag and the swastika. And at the same time, their own emblem contains the black sun of the occult, which was a Nazi SS emblem. And it also contains the sideways, you know, lightning insignia of the SS. I mean, this is on throughout the Ukrainian military you can see that black sun of the occult on their body armor. Western Ukraine backed the Nazis. It was a headquarters for the Nazis SS. The CIA under Allen Dulles actually gave immunity from prosecution to the Nazis of Ukraine from the Nuremberg trials. So there's a long history of the United States and our intelligence agencies funding and arming Nazis in Ukraine. These are the actual Nazis. From the second World War who, if you go back to the Nuremberg trials, said that they were planning for a thousand-year reich. To pretend that this war is about Russia and Ukraine is just a bare-faced lie. If Putin has been warning for 15 years that he is not going to stand by while the globalists take over the world, build bioweapons facilities, and whatever else they're doing in Ukraine. Ukraine has been a center of money laundering for, you know, many of the leaders in this country for how long? Billions of U.S. dollars have been laundered through Ukraine and we say nothing about it. These are our tax dollars.”\r\nEnd Quote\r\n",

      "Narration": "The one and only Infowars dot com reports:\r\n\r\nActor and self-proclaimed liberal Russell Brand is stimulating the minds of the masses by questioning some of the narratives mainstream media and establishment politicians are pushing amid the Ukraine-Russia war.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, Brand uploaded a video titled, “We’re Not Allowed To Discuss This,” to his popular YouTube channel where he went on to detail how the planet got to the point of this potentially World War 3 starting event.\r\n\r\nThe presentation provides some historical background regarding NATO’s encroachment on Russia, Washington’s influence on the globalist bureaucracy and more.\r\n\r\nBy allowing his viewers to hear the arguments from both sides of the complex geopolitical conflict, Brand hopes to help the average person better decide for themselves what’s really going on.\r\n\r\n“Ukraine has become an ideological battleground,” he said. “On one hand, Russia wants Ukraine to be available for ongoing alliance, or to have independent political systems, or political systems that are favorable to Russia’s end. And the West wants Ukraine to have political systems that are favorable to its intentions. There is no one, I think, that’s really asking what’s best for Ukraine.”\r\n\r\nThis video has been watched more than 1.5 million times in three days.",

      "Narration": "Very predictably, mainstream media was not impressed that a celebrity with a huge following of 5 million people on YouTube only, is making waves and going against their narrative.\r\n\r\nThe Independent reports:\r\n\r\nWhen did Russell Brand decide comedy wasn’t enough for him? For most of his time in the public eye, the Essex-born funnyman has been better known for his off-stage antics than any particulars of his comic craft. There was his short-lived marriage to Katy Perry. His bullying of Andrew Sachs over voicemail on Jonathan Ross’s radio show. His vocal objections to voting in general elections back in 2013. Well over a decade on from all that, his personal website now describes him as an award-winning comedian, actor, author, a “passionate activist for mental health and drug rehabilitation”, and, more grandiosely, a “public thought leader”. See, he can still make you laugh.\r\n\r\nIt is in this last capacity that Brand operates his self-titled YouTube channel, publishing daily videos to 5.3 million followers and counting. These videos have prompted some to accuse Brand of peddling conspiracy theories – and it’s easy to see why. Hot-button issues such as Covid vaccines and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have countless clips devoted to them. Usually they’re framed with some sort of contrarian take or calling out hypocrisy in the mainstream media. They frequently have alarmist titles, hinting at a vague, world-altering conspiracy. A few recent examples: “WW3 – So THIS Is Why They Want Russia War”; “So They DO Run The World”; “I’ve Been Warned Not To Talk About This”. They often open with Brand addressing viewers as “awakening wonders” – “awakening” being his New Age-inflected buzzword of choice.\r\n\r\nWith his beard, long hair and loose-fitting, wide-necked shirts, it’s hard to shake the sense that there’s something cultish about Brand’s whole presentation. And yet, despite all the Matrix-like “here’s the real truth”-ing, Brand’s videos are also thoroughly beholden to his puerile sense of humour, with each new revelation incongruously seasoned with a splash of his insufferable schtick.\r\n",
