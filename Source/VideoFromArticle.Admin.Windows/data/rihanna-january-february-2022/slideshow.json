      "Narration": "Rihanna appeared on Instagram on Friday to share a professional update with her audience of 166 million.\r\n\r\nThe 33-year-old singer-turned-business mogul posted an image of a Savage X Fenty store to announce she's launching them in multiple major cities.\r\n\r\nShe captioned the photo, '2022, we coming in HOT!' as she got fans excited for what's to come. Rihanna went on to say, 'we bout to bring you a whole new #SavageXFenty experience with the launch of our brick-and-mortar retail stores!'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe image showed a colorful store front with the brand's imprint at the top in large white letters. It featured several lingerie-clad manikins in the windows as well. Riri noted how much she's looking forward to the launch, adding, 'can’t believe it’s actually that time, and I can’t wait for you to have this experience irl….'\r\n\r\nShe named Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia, and Washington DC as the first locations to offer in-person shopping. And lastly she directed consumers to 'watch the @savagexfenty feed for details.' Aside from her business empire, Rihanna is doing well on the personal front too. \r\n\r\nAt the end of November she was named a National Hero in her home country of Barbados.\r\n\r\nShe's also been enjoying a solid romance with her rapper beau A$AP Rocky, who she's often spotted spending time with in New York and LA.

      "Narration": "She has been blazing the promo trail with a series of sexy snaps to plug her incredible Savage X Fenty's unisex Love On the Edge collection.\r\n\r\nAnd Rihanna continued to flaunt her collection as she posed up a storm in the latest images from the campaign - this time rocking a stunning pastel set - as she was joined by a legion . \r\n\r\nThe hitmaker-turned-business mogul, 33, wore a lace-up bralet in a delicate pink and orange hue paired with high-waisted bottoms and staggering heels. Rihanna was displaying every inch of her famous curves as she posed up a storm for the sexy snaps, with her full figure enhanced by her self-designed look. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe lace-up detailing on the lingerie tied in with the other looks in the collection, yet her pastel colouring stood out against the other stars' red looks. She was joined on-set by Lourdes Leon, Quannah, Souizz, Alva Claire and Evan Leff.\r\n\r\nRihanna launched her popular Savage X Fenty brand in 2018 in an effort to providing more inclusive sizing and colors. So far, the brand has increased in popularity with online-only sales, but the songstress is planning to increase the brand's profile by opening five new brick-and-mortar stores in 2022.\r\n\r\nEarlier in January, the brand announced upcoming store openings in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., though the specific opening dates haven't yet been announced.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, Rihanna shared a photo of a colorfully lit store. She wrote: 'Can't believe it's actually that time, and I can't wait for you to have this experience irl'. When Rihanna isn't busy managing her fashion and cosmetics empire, she's lately been spending time on both the West and East Coast with her boyfriend A$AP Rocky.\r\n\r\nThe two were spotted on several occasions earlier in January around Los Angeles, but on Sunday night they were seen braving New York City's chillier climates.\r\n\r\nThe couple have been friends for years, going back to the 2010s, but it wasn't until 2020 that their romance began to heat up.",

      "Narration": "Rihanna delivered a take-away to her boyfriend ASAP Rocky amid rumours the couple are expecting a baby.\r\n\r\nThe 33-year-old singer rocked a sporty casual look as she arrived at a recording studio in New York with a special delivery for the rapper, who was hard at work.\r\n\r\nRihanna was seen going into the building carrying a bag of food from Deliveroo, and she beamed as she walked out of the studio after treating Rocky to a bite to eat.\r\n\r\nThe Umbrella hitmaker wore an oversized American football jersey teamed with a baggy jacket, orange Prada opera gloves, a Goyard clutch bag, and her favourite Amina Muaddi stilettos.\r\n\r\nIt’s the second night in a row she’s been pictured wearing huge football jerseys as dresses, and she ditched the trousers in favour of a Martine Rose football shirt, Balenciaga parka, Saint Laurent earrings, Miu Miu leather gloves, and Amina Muaddi sandals while out and about New York’s Soho district with Rocky.\r\n\r\nRumours are rife that Rihanna is expecting her first baby with the rapper, but in December, she shut down reports with a DM to a follower on Instagram.\r\n\r\nShe replied to a fan who cheekily asked her if they could be invited to her baby shower, and wrote: “Haaaaa! Stawwwp! You ain’t came to the first 10 baby showers! Y’all breed me every year dammit lol.”",

Their late arrival at the Met Gala 2021 was worth the wait: Rih wore a custom Balenciaga overcoat with voluminous puffs, while Rocky looked equally snug in a rainbow patchwork wrap by ERL. \r\n\r\nTheir bundle of joy joins a roster of celebrity offspring arriving imminently.

And sources tell me the lovebirds, both 33, are set to walk down the aisle in her home country Barbados.\r\n\r\nThe singer is also lining up the island’s Prime Minister as godmother to the unborn child.\r\n\r\n“ Rihanna is totally smitten with A$AP,” the source says. “They have a very close bond and Rihanna has always been quite traditional.\r\n\r\n“They will be married, for sure. She has told pals she wants to be with him for ever, and he has said the same.\r\n\r\n“There are no plans yet as to when the nuptials will be but it won’t be before the baby is born. She has always wanted to get married and A$AP is her forever person.\r\n\r\n“The wedding will be in Barbados as they both have family there, it’s the place that brought them together, and holds a very special place in their hearts.”\r\n\r\nRihanna announced her pregnancy by showing off her bump in a New York photoshoot before posting snaps on Instagram.\r\n\r\nThe pair were confirmed to be dating in November 2020 after she split from her boyfriend of three years, Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel, in January of that year.\r\n\r\nThe source added that Barbados PM Mia Mottley could be the baby’s godmother.\r\n\r\nLast year Mia, 56, declared Rihanna a national hero. The source adds: “Rihanna adores Mia, and there is talk that she might make her a godparent to the child.”\r\n\r\n",

      "Narration": "Rihanna worked, worked, worked, worked, worked, worked extra hard to keep her pregnancy a secret, even from those close to her.\r\n\r\nFollowing weeks of speculation from fans, the 33-year-old singer and fashion designer confirmed via media photos on Jan. 31 that she and partner A$AP Rocky are expecting their first baby. Speaking to E!'s Justin Sylvester at a Feb. 11 event celebrating her Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin brands (available at Sephora and fentybeauty.com), Rihanna recalled how \"hard\" it was to keep her pregnancy under wraps.\r\n\r\n\"It was harder for me to keep it from my posse, because they're around me, they know my habits,\" she said. \"They're like, 'You don't want something to drink? You're not smoking?' And I'm eating all the things I'm not used to eating. They know I hate sweets and I'm all of a sudden asking for cookies and donuts. But finally, I just had to let it all out, and they were all shocked, of course, as the world was shocked as well.\"\r\n\r\nRihanna also spoke about how she felt after learning she was pregnant. Like many expectant moms in their first trimester, the star was cautious and reluctant to celebrate.\r\n\r\n\"When I first found out, it's not real, you know? I was like, 'This is not for real, right?'\" she said. \"And then, it was and it's almost like you don't want to get too excited too soon because it's great news, but you...want to see that it's going to see its way through. And I'm so glad that we're this far along and now I can celebrate with everyone.\"\r\nThe proud dad-to-be, 33, joined Rihanna at the bash and could barely keep his hands off as she walked her first red carpet since confirming her pregnancy.",

      "Narration": "Roses are so last season.\r\n\r\nIn a recap of what appears to be her and A$AP Rocky's Valentine's Day, pregnant Rihanna gave fans a look inside their quirky celebrations, which included a bouquet made of Legos. She captioned the series, \"nerdz.\"\r\n\r\nOther photos from the Feb. 16 collection included what looked to be her boyfriend's hand throwing up a peace sign while they enjoyed an oceanside dinner. Plus, a snap of a card featuring lyrics from Method Man's track \"All I Need\" and a fiery sunset.\r\n\r\nThe date night comes just days after the two attended a party celebrating Rihanna's Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin brands at Goya Studios in Los Angeles on Feb. 11, where she showed off her baby bump in a green, sequined halter top by The Attico and see-though pants.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to E!'s Justin Sylvester at a Feb. 11 event, the \"Umbrella\" singer, 33, recalled how \"hard\" it was to keep her pregnancy under wraps.\r\n\r\n\"It was harder for me to keep it from my posse, because they're around me, they know my habits,\" she said. \"They're like, 'You don't want something to drink? You're not smoking?' And I'm eating all the things I'm not used to eating. They know I hate sweets and I'm all of a sudden asking for cookies and donuts. But finally, I just had to let it all out, and they were all shocked, of course, as the world was shocked as well.\"\r\n\r\nNews of Rihanna's pregnancy broke late last month when a headline-making maternity shoot dropped on social media. In the photos obtained by E! News, Rihanna debuted her baby bump wearing a pink puffer coat from Chanel's Fall 1996 collection by Karl Lagerfeld, per Paper magazine. The \"L$D\" rapper, 33, was also seen by her side, even planting a kiss on her forehead in one sweet shot.\r\n\r\nShe confirmed she was becoming a mom in a follow up Instagram post on Feb. 2, giving fans another glimpse of the bump as she pulled up an orange jersey and wrote, \"how the gang pulled up to black history month.\"\r\n\r\nThe longtime friends turned fashion's It Couple seemed destined to become parents together. During a May 2021 interview with GQ, A$AP couldn't help but gush over his girlfriend or \"the love of my life,\" as he called her.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen asked what it felt like to be in a relationship, he told the outlet, \"So much better. So much better when you got the One. She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones. I think when you know, you know.\" ",

      "Narration": "Excuse us while we pick our jaws up from the floor, Rihanna is out in Paris again. At this point the pregnant Fenty queen is playing a game of one upmanship with herself when it comes to maternity wear. Spoiler alert: she’s knocked it out of the park again.\r\n\r\nEveryone’s favourite bad gal took her front row seat at the Dior autumn/winter 2022 show wearing a black lace babydoll dress that took the underwear as outerwear trend to its most literal point. With a leather trench draped around her shoulders and heavy silver jewellery to distract the eye, Rihanna and her Gloss Bombed lips smized in the face of everyone who thought wearing a bralette this season was outré.The smouldering sheer new-season Dior look gave us shades of Adam Selman and that glittering naked dress moment at the CFDAs. Seven years on, Rih’s commitment to serving looks is still as unwavering. Given the option of wearing maternity Lycra, she’ll take Off-White PVC, thank you very much. To over-the-bump jeans, she’ll say her low-slung Balenciagas will do just nicely. It’s business as usual for this poster girl for original style who, by the time of writing, will already have slipped into something even more fabulous.In terms of commitment to personal style, this woman is in a league of her own. Oh na na, what’s her name?",

But I like challenges.'\r\nRihanna, who is expecting her firstborn child by her boyfriend A$AP Rocky, dished: 'There's a pregnancy glow. There's also those days, girl.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Umbrella singer added: 'Especially in the third trimester where you wake up and you're like, oh, do I have to get dressed? Makeup for sure helps you feel like a real person. I just focused a lot on moisturizing and on contouring.'\r\n\r\nShe reflected: 'The face gets a little round and chubby. The nose starts to spread. Everything is a challenge, from getting dressed and how you're going to do your makeup. But I like challenges.'\r\n\r\nRihanna shared: 'I like things that force me to be creative and create in new ways. And with beauty, there's so much that you can do.'\r\n\r\nThe S&M hitmaker is apparently an avid Real Housewives watcher and shares that she connects with Heather Dubrow and Teresa Giudice's approach to motherhood.\r\n\r\n'Heather Dubrow is so chic while being a mom. Just love the way that she just allows her kids to be who they are. And that's really inspiring to me. But Teresa from Jersey does not play about her kids,' said the Barbadian bombshell.\r\n\r\nTeresa, said Rihanna, 'will flatten you about those kids. And that resonates with me a lot because I feel like that's the type of mom I'm going to be. Psycho about it.'\r\n\r\nRihanna quipped that when the baby is born she will become the sort of parent whose attitude is: 'You talk about my kids, it's over.'",
