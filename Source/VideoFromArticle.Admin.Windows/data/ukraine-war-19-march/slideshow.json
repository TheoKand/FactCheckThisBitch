The Daily Mail, reports:\r\n\r\nMayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko has been praised after his blunt answer to a question about Vladimir Putin's claims to only fire upon military targets during his invasion of Ukraine. \r\n\r\nKlitschko, who was leading a group of journalists around a badly bombed street in Kyiv, responded 'bullshit' when asked about the Kremlin's claims. \r\n\r\nThe former heavyweight boxer turned and pointed towards the shell of an apartment building destroyed by Russian munitions and asks 'is this a military target'. \r\n\r\nThe short video, which was posted online, has been viewed my more than two million people. \r\n\r\n\r\nRussia has increased the intensity of its attack on Kyiv despite diplomatic efforts of brokering an end to the conflict.  \r\n\r\nYesterday's strikes on the 20th day of Russia's invasion targeted a western district of Kyiv, disrupting a relative calm that had returned after an initial advance by Moscow's forces was stopped in the early days of the war.\r\n\r\nA senior US defence source said the Russians were using long-range fire to hit civilian targets within Kyiv with increasing frequency but that their ground forces were making little to no progress around the country. The official said Russian forces were still about nine miles from the centre of Kyiv.",

It is well known to everyone that the Russian armed forces do not bomb cities. No matter how many videos are doctored by NATO structures and how many video clips and photo fakes are pumped out, the truth will come out.”\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Zakharova’s statements.\r\n\r\nRussia’s Defence Ministry denied the Ukrainian allegations a day earlier and instead accused the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, of blowing up the building after holding hostages there and using the upper floors from which to fire at Russian forces.\r\n\r\nThe Azov fighters have a base in Mariupol. Ukraine is sticking to its version of events.\r\n\r\nIgor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for Russia’s Defence Ministry, said in a statement that Ukrainian footage appeared to show that all the windows of nearby buildings were intact and that there was no evidence on the ground of a bomb being dropped from the air.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Konashenkov’s statements.",

      "Narration": "Euronews Reports:\r\n\r\nSurvivors are beginning to emerge from a bombed theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol on Thursday afternoon, nearly 24 hours after the building was hit by a Russian airstrike.\r\n\r\nOfficials say there were \"more than a thousand\" civilians inside the building at the time of the attack, sheltering there after fleeing their own homes amid fierce fighting in the southern city.\r\n\r\nRescue workers are scrambling to rescue hundreds of people trapped inside the basement of the theatre with photos showing a large section of the grand, three-story building in the city centre collapsed to a smoking ruin.\r\n\r\nRescuers have started clearing rubble that had blocked the entrance to the basement, despite new strikes reported elsewhere in the city.\r\n\r\nMiraculously, the shelter itself seems to have stood firm. \r\n\r\nAt least as recently as Monday, huge white letters on the pavement in front of and behind the theatre spelt out “CHILDREN” in Russian to alert warplanes of those inside, according to images released by the Maxar space technology company.\r\n\r\nThe Russian defence ministry denied bombing the theatre or anywhere else in Mariupol on Wednesday. Instead, the Russians blamed a Ukrainian far-right militia the Azov Brigade, for attacking the theatre.",
