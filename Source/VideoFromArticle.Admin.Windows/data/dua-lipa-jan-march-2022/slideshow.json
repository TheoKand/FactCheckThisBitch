The clip, which sees Richy exclaim “Dua Lipa in concert? Are you kidding me?” soon went viral and has racked up almost 2million likes since.\r\n\r\nAnd earlier this week Papa Richy got the chance to meet the pop star during her appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\r\n\r\n“We reached out to him, pretending that we were a radio station in New York and told him that he won a contest for the number one TikTok video of the year — he believed this, he loved it,” Fallon explained to the audience. “Yesterday, we flew him and his granddaughter to New York and he thinks he’s about to be interviewed on a radio show and get a tour of 30 Rock. He has no clue what’s going down.”\r\n\r\n“He’s going to get the surprise of his life\" added Lipa.\r\n\r\nRichy was then brought out of a dressing room for his “first radio interview” and led onto The Tonight Show. After a few seconds, he clocked Dua Lipa was standing next to Jimmy Fallon and reacted accordingly. “Oh my god!”\r\n\r\n“I read somewhere that one of your dreams is to dance with Dua Lipa,” continued Fallon before The Roots laid down a disco-inspired groove for the pair to dance to.",

      "Narration": "It’s almost become a model in recent years: If a song’s a hit, the copyright-infringement lawsuits follow, and Dua Lipa was clobbered with two of them in four days last week. Her global hit “Levitating,” which has spent 68 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, has drawn two lawsuits from songwriters claiming the song infringes on their compositions, according to multiple media reports.\r\n\r\nThe first was filed March 1 by a Florida reggae group called Artikal Sound System, claiming that Lipa’s song lifts from their relatively obscure 2017 track, “Live Your Life.” That complaint includes little specific detail beyond claiming that the two tracks are so similar that it was “highly unlikely that ‘Levitating’ was created independently.”\r\n\r\nIn the second, more-detailed legal complaint, filed on March 4 in New York, songwriters L. Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer accused Lipa of copying both their 1979 song “Wiggle and Giggle All Night” and 1980 song “Don Diablo,” two tracks dating from the disco era. \r\n\r\nIn an unusual statement for a legal complaint, lawyers for Brown and Linzer resorted to puns to make their case: “Defendants have levitated away plaintiffs’ intellectual property,” they wrote. “Plaintiffs bring suit so that defendants cannot wiggle out of their willful infringement.”\r\n\r\nReps for Lipa, Warner Music and the multiple writers and publishers connected to the song either declined or did not immediately respond to Variety’s requests for comment, punning or no.",

      "Narration": "Dua Lipa has revealed how she stays in such incredible shape.\r\n\r\nThe New Rules singer opened up about her diet secrets on her brand new podcast Dua Lipa: At Your Service.\r\n\r\nSharing her daily rituals with fans, she said: “I drink a lot of water for my skin. I take vitamins, I take Omega 3.\r\n\r\n“I don’t eat after 6pm. I fast. I feel like with my skin it really helps.”\r\n\r\nShe explained: “When I eat really late my body does not really work through and it takes too long to process food and it does not prepare anything else in my body.”\r\n\r\nThe 26-year-old shared the key to her diet is all about striking the right balance between healthy and the occasional treat.\r\n\r\nFor breakfast, her go-tos are eggs or fruit followed by a banana and cashew butter before a workout.\r\n\r\nLunch is chicken salad with vegetables and a cold juice. While dinner is more vegetables with fish.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Viva magazine, Dua said: “I try and work out as much as I can.\r\n\r\n“I love doing something that’s really fast and quick, like a 15-minute High intensity session which I can do before I start my day.\r\n\r\n“If I’ve got a really early call time, I don’t want to be waking up hours before so I do a high intensity workout, shower, breakfast and I’m on my way.”\r\n\r\nThe moves Dua usually does are moutain climbers, jumping jacks and burpees – although she’s not a massive fan of a plank.\r\n\r\nTo mix up her workouts, she supplements her training with spinning classes, boxing, yoga and pilates.",
