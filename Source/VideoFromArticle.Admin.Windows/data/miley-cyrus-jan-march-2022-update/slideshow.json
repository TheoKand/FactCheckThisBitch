      "Narration": "Miley Cyrus had a MAJOR wardrobe fail while co-hosting her New Year's Eve Party special on NBC with Pete Davidson, which was streamed live from Miami, Florida on Friday night.\r\n\r\nThe 29-year-old Hannah Montana alum was performing hit single Party In The USA just moments after the clock struck midnight when her top - which was held together by silver straps - came undone.\r\n\r\nShe was forced to catch it with her hands and appeared stunned as she looked down at her chest.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing a total pro, Cyrus swiftly made her way backstage while her band and backup singers did their best to carry on the stalled performance. \r\n\r\nMoments later, Miley reemerged wearing a bright red blazer in place of her broken top and, referencing to one of the line's in Party In the USA, joked that, 'Everybody's DEFINITELY looking at me now!' \r\n\r\nShe also joked that her current outfit was still the most clothed she's ever been during a performance.\r\n\r\nParty In The USA was part of a Miley medley consisting of her 2020 song Midnight Sky and her controversial 2013 hit We Can't Stop.\r\n\r\nHer unreliable top boasted a cowl neckline and several strategic holes yet it was the glitzy straps that failed the star.\r\n\r\nIt was paired with a matching skirt that just barely concealed her derriere as she twirled around on stage.\r\n\r\nDespite the two-piece's daring nature, Miley's outfit did stay in tact while singing Midnight Sky and We Can't Stop with featured artist 24kGoldn. \r\n\r\nPete was forced to take center stage as Miley got herself situated with her glam squad, with the comedian acknowledging that there was 'almost a boob slip' on stage.\r\n\r\nCyrus, eventually, returned to confront her shocked audience with another goosebump-inducing song.",

Cyrus growing with her audience has led to her continued success, Advani said.\r\n\r\n“We grew up with her,” journalism junior Norene Bassin said. “We watched her start on Disney. We watched her go through her trying to break out of the Disney phase. We watched her find herself.”",

      "Narration": "Cyrus shares intimate moment with fans at Super Bowl Music Festival concert, one of a number of star-studded events for Super Bowl weekend.\r\n\r\nMiley Cyrus says she’s “scared” to be back on stage again after a year of Covid uncertainties limited touring for most of 2021. The singer performed at the Bud Light Super Bowl Music Festival over the weekend in Los Angeles, stopping her set halfway through to have an “honest moment” with the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Standing up here right now, it doesn’t feel the same as if you would have come to see me three or four years ago,” she admitted before 15,000 or so fans at Crypto.com Arena. “I’m just finding my feet along this platform again.”\r\n\r\n“I know that all of us are going through that same experience,” she continued, “just trying to integrate back into a reality that was moving so fast, so naturally. And now, something that should just be like breathing is suddenly difficult and anxiety-inducing and scary. I just want you to know,” Cyrus said, “that even though I’m up here with all of you, I’m just as scared as everybody else about where the world is going [and] what the future holds. But the good news is, we’re not alone,” she declared. “We’re all in this together.”\r\n\r\nCyrus performed a full setlist of songs for the Super Bowl event, including the live debut of her song, “Never Be Me,” off her 2020 album, Plastic Hearts. Sporting a Gucci Love Parade crop top and leggings, the singer belted her way through the Mark Ronson-produced ballad, which Cyrus wrote about not wanting to be boxed in or having to fit a specific mold (Sample lyric: “If you’re looking for someone to be all that you need, that’ll never be me”).",
