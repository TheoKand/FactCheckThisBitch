      "Narration": "Amber Davies puts on a red hot performance as she's doused in water in a plunging red gown before slipping into a racy PVC mini dress for another sizzling Cabaret All Stars show\r\n\r\nShe made her debut hosting the burlesque and circus extravaganza earlier this month. \r\n\r\nAnd Amber Davies put on a very raunchy display which saw her doused in water as she continued performing at Cabaret All Stars at Proud Embankment in London on Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe former Love Island star, 25, sizzled in a plunging red gown before slipping into a black PVC mini dress as she seductively climbed up the side of the stage.\r\n\r\nAmber appeared in her element as she entertained the crowd in her sexy scarlet dress which featured a thigh-high split and a low neckline which highlighted her cleavage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd her red hot performance was soon cooled down as she founded herself drenched in a spray of water on stage.\r\n\r\nThe theatre star sensually ran her hands through her brunette locks and closed her eyes as the show stepped up a gear.\r\n\r\nAnd one point, she was joined by a hunky shirtless performer who helped push her on a giant swing up on stage. \r\n\r\nNot content with sending temperatures soaring with her first outfit, Amber had also slipped into a racy PVC number as she continued to put on quite the show. \r\n\r\nThe beauty wowed in the gloved, skintight number which she teamed with yellow, knee-high snakeskin boots. \r\n\r\nAmber finished her showstopping look with dark shades and a sweep of pillar box red lipstick.\r\n\r\nShe oozed confidence as she strutted about in between the the delighted audience. \r\n\r\nAmber also looked stunning in backstage snaps with the star seen posing up a storm in her flowing red dress.\r\n\r\nThe performance was attended by her fellow Love Island alumni Kaz Kamwi, 27, who looked sensational in a white mini dress.\r\n\r\nThe reality star was joined by her sister Banji, with the blogger wowing in a black mini dress and orange heels. \r\n\r\nWoman of the moment Amber also stopped to pose behind-the-scenes with Cabaret performers Jessica Talbot-Smith and Lady Lydia.\r\n\r\nAmber once again showcased her toned physique in a black crop top which she teamed with an oversized blazer and pale jeans. \r\n\r\nIt comes after Amber says she's finally found love with boyfriend Nick Kyriacou as the couple plan on buying their first house together following her decision to give up alcohol.  \r\n\r\nThe Love Island winner admits she even begged her businessman beau, 29, to propose while they holidayed together in the Maldives.\r\n\r\nShe told The Sun: 'He’s my future baby daddy. I was asking him every single day on holiday if he was going to propose. \r\n\r\n'It’s 100 per cent on the cards. We’ve been together for nearly two years. He is \"The One\". \r\n\r\n'We’re buying a property in Surrey, so I’m moving from Essex. It’s all happening for me. I feel like I’m in a transitional stage in my life and I’m so excited.'\r\n\r\nThe couple found love during lockdown, after being introduced by a mutual friend in 2020."

      "Narration": "Russian and Ukrainian officials gave their most upbeat assessments yet on Sunday of progress in their talks on the war in Ukraine, suggesting there could be a positive result within days.\r\n\r\nUkraine said it is willing to negotiate but will not surrender or accept any ultimatums, as a key Ukrainian negotiator said Moscow is beginning to 'talk constructively' ahead of a video-conference on Monday between representatives from both countries.\r\n\r\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also said he would meet Vladimir Putin for peace talks, saying that whilst this is a 'hard path, this path is needed'.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Russian negotiator meanwhile claimed there had been 'substantial progress' in the talks, despite Putin's forces continuing their onslaught of Ukraine on Sunday, with missiles hitting a large Ukrainian military base just 12 miles from the border with NATO member Poland, killing 35 people.  \r\n\r\nNeither side indicated what the scope of any agreement might be, but Russia has previously demanded Ukraine cease military action, change its constitution to enshrine neutrality so it cannot join the EU or NATO, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent territories.\r\n\r\nUkrainian negotiator and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said: 'We will not concede in principle on any positions. Russia now understands this. Russia is already beginning to talk constructively.'\r\n\r\nHe added: 'I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days.'\r\n\r\n'Our goal is that in this struggle, in this difficult negotiating work, Ukraine will get the necessary result... for peace and security,' Zelensky said in a video address early Monday.    \r\n\r\nSeparately, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Russia was showing signs of willingness to engage in substantive negotiations about ending a conflict in which thousands have died. More than 2.5 million people have fled.    \r\n\r\nLeonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia's negotiating team, told state-run television network RT Sunday: 'We see significant progress' in the negotiations. \r\n\r\n'According to my personal expectations, this progress may grow in the coming days into a joint position of both delegations, into documents for signing,' he added. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it emerged that Russia has asked China - which has not condemned Russia's barbaric invasion of Ukraine - for military equipment, according to US officials. \r\n\r\nTheir public comments were issued almost at the same time. Today was day 18 of the war that began when Russian forces invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin calls a special military operation.\r\n\r\nIn a tweet, Podolyak said Russia was carefully listening to Ukraine's proposals. 'Our demands are - the end of the war and the withdrawal of [Russian] troops. I see the understanding and there is a dialogue,' he said."

      "Narration": "Pregnant woman and her baby die after Ukraine hospital bombing: Mother-to-be in image that shocked the world begged doctors 'kill me now' as she realized child would not survive and medics battled to save her\r\n\r\nAn injured pregnant woman and her unborn baby - whose image being stretchered from her Putin-bombed maternity ward became one of the war's most shocking images - have both died.\r\n\r\nPictures of the unnamed mother-to-be in agony as she was carried from the Mariupol hospital appalled the watching world.\r\n\r\nShe had come under attack in the very place she had thought safe to bring new life into the world.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn video and photos shot last Wednesday after the attack, the woman was seen stroking her bloodied lower abdomen as rescuers rushed her through the rubble in the besieged city of Mariupol.\r\n\r\nIt was among the most brutal moments so far in Russia's 19-day war on Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe woman was rushed to another hospital, closer to the frontline, where doctors worked to keep her alive.\r\n\r\nBut realising she was losing her baby, medics said that she cried out to them: 'Kill me now.' \r\n\r\nThis morning the doctors trying to save them both spoke of the huge efforts trying to save them.\r\n\r\nSurgeon Timur Marin found the woman's pelvis crushed and hip detached. Medics delivered the baby via caesarean section, but it showed 'no signs of life', the surgeon said. They then began work on the mother.\r\n\r\n'More than 30 minutes of resuscitation of the mother didn't produce results,' Mr Marin said on Saturday. 'Both died.'\r\n\r\nIn the chaos after Wednesday's air strike, medics did not have time to get the woman's name before her husband and father came to take away her body.\r\n\r\nSomeone came to retrieve her, they said – so she did not end up in the mass graves being dug for many of Mariupol's growing number of dead.\r\n\r\nAfter being accused of war crimes, Russian officials claimed the maternity hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian extremists to use as a base, and that no patients or medics were left inside.\r\n\r\nRussia's ambassador to the UN and the Russian Embassy in London called the images 'fake news'.\r\n\r\nAssociated Press journalists, who have been reporting from inside blockaded Mariupol since early in the war, documented the attack and saw the victims and damage first-hand.\r\n\r\nThey shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward, with medics shouting and children crying.\r\n\r\nThe AP team then tracked down the victims on Friday and Saturday in the hospital where they had been transferred, on the outskirts of Mariupol.\r\n\r\nIn a city without food supplies, water, power or heat for more than a week, electricity from emergency generators is reserved for operating rooms.\r\n\r\nAs survivors described their ordeal, explosions outside shook the walls.\r\n\r\nThe shelling and shooting in the area is sporadic but relentless.\r\n\r\nEmotions are running high, even as doctors and nurses concentrate on their work.\r\n\r\nBlogger Mariana Vishegirskaya gave birth to a girl the day after the air strike, and wrapped her arm around newborn Veronika as she recounted Wednesday's bombing.\r\n\r\nAfter photos and video showed her navigating down debris-strewn stairs and clutching a blanket around her frame.\r\n\r\nRussian officials claimed she was an actor in a staged attack.\r\n\r\n'It happened on March 9 in Hospital number three in Mariupol. We were laying in wards when glasses, frames, windows and walls flew apart,' Vishegirskaya, still wearing the same polka dot pyjamas as when she fled, said.\r\n\r\n'We don't know how it happened. We were in our wards and some had time to cover themselves, some didn't.'\r\n\r\nHer ordeal was one among many in Mariupol, which has become a symbol of resistance to Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to crush democratic Ukraine and redraw the world map in his favour.\r\n\r\nThe failure to subordinate Mariupol has pushed Russian forces to broaden their offensive elsewhere in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Azov Sea port city of 430,000, key to creating a land bridge from Russia to Russian-annexed Crimea, is slowly starving.\r\n\r\n"
