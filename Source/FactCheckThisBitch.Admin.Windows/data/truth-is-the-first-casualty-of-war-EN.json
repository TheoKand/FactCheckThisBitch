On May 2nd, a large group of Right sector radicals and football hooligans that had travelled all the way from Kiev, attacked the activists. Violent fights followed and the local police failed to control the situation. The pro Russia locals tried to take refuge in a nearby trade union building. They barricaded the entrance to stop the radicals from entering, but the building was set on fire by Molotov bombs. People that jumped from the balconies to escape the burning building were beaten to death or shot on the ground, by the US backed Ukrainian ultra nationalists. 42 people died in the Trade Union Building. Little has been done by west backed Ukrainian governments since then, to hold the perpetrators accountable.",
