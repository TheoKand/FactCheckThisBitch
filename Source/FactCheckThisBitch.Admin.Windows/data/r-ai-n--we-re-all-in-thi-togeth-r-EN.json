  "Conclusion": "- Developing countries have imposed lockdowns and then borrowed money en mass from the IMF and World Bank.\r\n- Advanced countries have outlawed the real economy and replaced it with a Covid Economy.\r\n- Media organizations, journalists get free money to present the daily case numbers.\r\n- Hospitals and health care practitioners are on the frontline of receiving extra funding.\r\n- Everyone and their dog is cashing out the never-ending cash that flows from the top down.\r\n- Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum is keen on merging our digital, biological and physical identities, presumably via vaccines based on \"synthetic biology\".\r\n- Perpetual lockdowns seem to have altered the world's economy in an irreversible way, en route to a Great Reset and Central Bank Digital Currencies.",
