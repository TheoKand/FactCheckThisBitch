00:03.88 Greek media organization Skai TV reached a new low. by shamelesly reporting that this footage is panicked Ukranians, rushing to hide in bunkers. 00:19.88 When in reality, this is a 2018 Rome Metro accident.00:25.68 FOX News, reported on quote, Armed Ukranian Citizens,resisting the invasion.00:31.58 Holding what appears to be cardboard assalt rifles. you can't make this shit up!00:41.38 FOX News and the Daily Mail, proceeded to report on an former Miss Ukraine, resisting the invasion. They used a photo she posted on her Instagram page. 00:55.18 This is actual footage of the heroic model slash Actress, taking cover from incoming gunfire, and Russian shells.Call us conspiracy theorists dear viewers, but it appears that she is posing rather than fighting. 01:10.98 The trustworthy UK media announced the invasion in synchrony. Reporters on the ground interviewed a lovely, injured, smiling lady, injured in the bombing of an Eastern Ukraine city.01:26.58 Twitter users have since identified, what appears to be the same unfortunate lady, in a separate scene, where she has suffered different wounds, and was bleeding from another part of her head. Totally plausible.01:42.38 A video emerged of a Rusian Tank supposedly running over a car. It was later fact checked, and the longer version video clearly shows the tank had skidded and lost control, while it's uncertain whether it was a Russian or Ukranian tank.01:57.08 More fake news has since emerged and got debunked. The refutation of sensational fake stories, rarely goes as viral as the original story.02:08.98 This creates a bang wagon effect, where the public sentiment about an event, is shaped early on. And is unlikely, to change later.02:28.46 The verified twitter account of the Ukranian Defence Ministry, joined in the fun, of spreading misinformation.02:42.86 The Ghost of Kiev ended up being footage from a flight simulation software.02:54.46 The always credible BBC, reported that the soldiers defending Snake island refused to surrender, and were all killed. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, has awarded each of the guards the posthumous title of "Hero of Ukraine".03:10.26 It hasn't been confirmed whether the brave Ukranians did indeed use foul language. 03:18.16 But it has been confirmed that the 82 brave and hungry soldiers were captured, and then fed by the Russian army.03:29.96 Reuters quoted an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office: The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been captured by Russian forces. This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today.03:45.76 In reality, having control of a half demolished, highly unstable nuclear accident site, is a huge liability,and hardly an asset for an attacking army. The two armies have been jointly maintaining the site. A video emerged showing just that, but YouTube has since banned it in most western countries.04:19.32 Ukraine and Kiev specifically is considered by Russians to be the birthplace of their nation. It carries special historic not to mention geopolitical importance, and therefore can't easily be left to fall under the influence of NATO and the United States. This would be kinda like If Pennsylvania Independence Hall, where the United States was formed, was located just outside the US border, and Russia was trying to bring it under it's political influence.04:46.12 At some point in early twenty tens, under constant pressure by the EU, Ukraine leadership started considering joining the union. This ofcourse would be a huge geopolitical upset in the area.04:58.02 Later on, Ukranian prime minister Yanukovychdecided to make a U turn and decided not join the block. As soon as that happened, protests errupted, that led to the 2014 Euro Maidan movement.05:09.82 Joining the EU comes with a lot of fine print, that is often overlooked by politicians. Like having to comply with all policies that are dictated by the European Comission, which cover pretty much all aspects of a country's governance.05:25.62 The Maidan movement was clearly subsidized by western actors. Russian officials and media were not impressed by their Western counterparts' visits to protest camps. The situation escallated, resulting in over 100 casualties in the Maidan square.05:41.42 The trial and investigation produced overwhelming evidence that protesters were killed by snipers at Maidan-controlled buildings, rather than by government snipers. This type of false flag operation to bring about a regime change,is right outside of the rulebook described by John Perkins in his best seller book.06:01.02 A famous MP was arrested on suspicion of planning an assault on parliament and supporting a coup. She was later released without charge.06:16.82 The Maidan "Orange Revolution" led to the pro Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing to the east of the country.06:32.62 And a new pro-austerity, pro-EU, pro NATO, pro IMF loans Prime Minister installed. 06:40.52 During this period, there were reports of widespread corruption, gold vanishing from the country's vaults, and state assents being sold off for next to nothing.06:56.32 During this period, Russia held a surprisingly moderate stance, and even offered to sell cheap has to Ukraine.07:04.22 The new prime minister Yatsenyuk, was not open to Russia leaning populations in the east of the country, deciding their own fate with a referendum. 07:12.12 The referendum did go ahead, and this resulted in tensions rising, which led to the annexation of Cremea by Russia.07:31.80 Time for a quiz, dear viewers. This photo is not a mostly peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration, or scenes from the January six Capitol Hill insurrection. 07:48.80 This is the Odessa massacre of May 2nd 2014. Let's briefly look into the tragic events of that day.08:06.20 You will also hear segments from the infamous intercepted phone call, between US Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, and US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt. Where they discuss the logistics of installing the puppet government of Yatsenyuk, after the Maidan revolution. According to the official Western media narrative, the USA had nothing to do with that uprising.08:29.90 The events of May 2nd 2014 and the Maidan revolution in general, are reported very differently in Western and Russian media. However after the war started in recent times, Russian media have been largely banned in western countries. Therefore it's harder for westerners to get the context of what appears to be an agressive act of war towards Ukraine. 08:45.70 If you want to watch some more of these videos, you can find the links in the description of this video. viewer discretion is advised.09:11.26 NATO and the United States, have a long history of bombing and invading countries. Interestingly enough, there was an air strike just three days after the war in Ukraine begun. 09:23.66 Sometimes internet trolls do a better job than mainstream media journalists.09:31.56 Japan’s moves to rewrite its pacifist constitution have sparked large protests in the country – but just how unusual is it for a country to not be involved in overseas conflict?09:39.46 From Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, the US has had a military presence across the world, from almost day one of her independence.What constitutes invasion? As one map below shows, the US has a military presence in much of the world without being an occupying force (though some would dispute tha.09:47.36 The U.S. is well known for its enormous defense budget, but how does it compare to the rest of the world's military spending?
