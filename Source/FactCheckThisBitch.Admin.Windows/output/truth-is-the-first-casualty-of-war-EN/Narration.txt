00:03.88 Greek media organization Skai TV reached a new low, by shamelesly reporting that this footage is panicked Ukranians, rushing to hide in bunkers. 00:19.88 When in reality, this is a 2018 Rome Metro accident.00:27.68 FOX News, reported on quote, Armed Ukranian Citizens, fighting off invading Russian solders.00:33.58 Holding what appears to be cardboard Assault rifles. you can't make this shit up!00:42.38 FOX News and the Daily Mail, proceeded to report on an former Miss Ukraine, resisting the invasion. They used a photo she posted, on her Instagram page. 00:56.18 This is actual footage of the heroic model slash Actress, taking cover from incoming gunfire, and Russian shells. Call us conspiracy theorists dear viewers, but it appears that she is posing rather than fighting. 01:11.98 The trustworthy UK media announced the invasion in synchrony. Reporters on the ground interviewed a lovely, smiling lady, injured in the bombing of an Eastern Ukraine city.01:27.58 Twitter users have since identified, what appears to be the same unfortunate lady, in a separate scene, where she has suffered different wounds, and was bleeding from another part of her head. Totally plausible.01:43.38 A video emerged of a Russian Tank supposedly running over a car. It was later fact checked, and the longer version video clearly shows the tank had skidded and lost control, while it's uncertain whether it was a Russian or Ukranian tank.02:01.08 More fake news has since emerged and got debunked. The truth behind sensational fake stories, rarely goes as viral as the original story.02:08.98 This creates a bang wagon effect, where the public sentiment about an event, is shaped early on. And is unlikely, to change later.02:20.46 The verified twitter account of the Ukranian Defence Ministry, joined in the fun, of spreading misinformation.02:34.86 The Ghost of Kiev ended up being footage from a flight simulation software.02:46.66 The always credible BBC, reported that the soldiers defending Snake island refused to surrender, and were all killed. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, has awarded each of the guards the posthumous title of "Hero of Ukraine".03:02.46 It hasn't been confirmed whether the brave Ukranians did indeed use foul language. 03:10.36 But it has been confirmed that the 82 brave and hungry soldiers were captured, and then fed by the Russian army.03:22.16 Reuters interviewed an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office. He said, quote. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been captured by Russian forces. This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today.03:37.96 In reality, having control of a half demolished, highly unstable nuclear accident site, is a huge liability,and hardly an asset for an attacking army. The two armies have been jointly maintaining the site. A video emerged showing just that, but YouTube has since banned it in most western countries.04:01.64 Let's have a look, at how western media was reporting the wars started by NATO and the United States.04:11.64 There was a certain excitement in the air, when NATO was bombing Yugoslavia back in the nineties.04:19.54 The term Collateral Damage became popular during that time, to describe the civilian casualties and destruction of intrastructure. 04:34.74 During the NATO intervention in Syria, mainstream media went into great detail, to calmly describe who is fighting who. There was no outrage and no one tweeted. I Stand with Syria! In reality, the current war in Ukraine is the escalation of an existing conflict, that started 8 years ago. More on that later.04:52.54 Further back in 2003, the United States attacked Iraq, to find the elusive weapons of mass destruction, that were never found. The US media then insisted on getting other countries to support their war. The term "Freedom Fries" became popular, in an attempt to cancel anything French, as the French did not support the Iraq war. Again, there was no widespread "I stand with Iraq" movement.05:20.12 Ukraine and Kiev specifically is considered by Russians, to be the birthplace of their nation. It carries special historic not to mention geopolitical importance, and therefore can't easily be left to fall under the influence of NATO and the United States. This would be kinda like If Pennsylvania Independence Hall, where the United States was formed, was located just outside the US border, and Russia was trying to bring it under it's political influence.05:46.92 At some point in early twenty tens,Ukraine leadership started entertaining the idea of joining the European Union.This of course would be a huge geopolitical upset in the area.05:58.72 Later on, Ukranian prime minister Yanukovych, decided to make a U-turn and not join the block. As soon as that happened, protests errupted, that led to the 2014 Euro Maidan movement.06:10.52 Joining the EU comes with a lot of fine print, that is often overlooked by politicians. Like having to balance public debt and not being able to have direct transnational deals, with countries outside the union.06:26.32 The Maidan revolution appeared to be subsidized by western actors. Russian officials and media were not impressed by their Western counterparts' visits to protest camps. The situation escallated, resulting in over 100 casualties in the Maidan square.06:42.12 The trial and investigation produced overwhelming evidence, that protesters were killed by snipers outposted on protester-controlled buildings. This type of false flag operation, to bring about a regime change,is right outside of the rulebook described by John Perkins, in his best seller book.07:05.72 A famous MP was arrested, on suspicion of planning an assault on parliament, and supporting a coup. She was later released without charge.07:15.52 The Maidan events also known as "Orange Revolution" or Revolution of dignity", led to the pro Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing to the east of the country.07:23.32 A new pro-austerity, pro-EU, pro-NATO Prime Minister was installed. The Russian speaking residents of Odessa, a city in the south of Ukraine, did not take well to the new government, which led to the events of May 2nd. More on this later.07:39.12 During this period, there were reports of widespread corruption, gold vanishing from the country's vaults, and state assets being sold off for next to nothing.07:50.92 Russia held a surprisingly moderate stance, and even offered to sell cheap natural gas to Ukraine.07:58.82 The new prime minister Yatsenyuk, was not open to pro-Russia populations in Crimea, deciding their own fate with a referendum. 08:07.72 In Crimea , the large majority of people are pro-Russian, they speak the language, have the same Orthodox Christian religion and ethnic background. The referendum did go ahead, and the overwhelming result led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia.08:27.40 Time for a quiz, dear viewers. Is this a mostly peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration? or scenes from the January six Capitol Hill insurrection?08:44.40 This is the Odessa massacre of May 2nd 2014. Let's briefly look into the tragic events of that day.08:55.80 What you heard there was segments from the infamous intercepted phone call, between US Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, and US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt. Where they discuss the logistics of installing the puppet government of Yatsenyuk, after the Maidan revolution. According to the official Western media narrative, the USA had nothing to do with that uprising.09:22.50 The events of May 2nd 2014 and the Maidan revolution in general, are reported very differently in Western and Russian media. However since the recent war in Ukraine started, Russian media have been largely banned in western countries. Therefore it's harder for westerners to get the context of the conflict that actually started many years ago.09:46.20 If you want to explore the Odessa events, you can find the links in the description of this video. viewer discretion is advised!09:59.88 The east of Ukraine has since been in a perpetual state of war and conflict. The west considers this a Russian-Ukranian war, and Russia considers this a civil Ukranian war. The fact of the matter is that the people of donetsk and lugansk, have had to live under these conditions for 8 years, dealing with incoming artillery fire and shelling.10:27.08 No solidarity from Western Media has been displayed during this time, and no one went on social media to proclaim how they "Stand with the Donetsk". Casualties are in the tens of thousands and up to one and a half million people have had to rellocate, to avoid the ongoing conflict of the last eight years. 10:46.88 These were obviously pro-Russian populations that were targeted by the West-controlled government of Ukraine10:58.56 The tension between the ever expanding NATO and Russia kept growing, and took a turn for the worst in December of 2021. 11:10.96 Russia drew distinct lines in the sand and called for de-escalation. Both sides pretend to be on the defence.11:20.76 In the early hours of Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed his nation, announcing a “special military operation” against Ukraine.12:24.54 NATO and the United States, have a long history of bombing and invading countries. Interestingly enough, there was an air strike just three days after the war in Ukraine begun. 12:38.94 The US is well known for its enormous defence budget. How does it compare to the rest of the world?12:50.64 Sometimes internet trolls do a better job than mainstream media journalists.12:58.54 Then again, sometimes mainstream media journalists remember how to journal.13:06.44  Like when the Independent wrote about the 9 most warmongering countries in the world.13:14.54 Or this one from the Guardian. Apparently, Peace nobel prize winner Barak Obama, has authorized more drone strikes than any of his predecessors. Resulting in thousands of civilians killed!13:30.32 A frenzy of cancelling everything Russian has possessed the West in recent weeks. Cancelling ballet shows, classical music symphonies and football players, is a new low in virtue signalling,woke silliness. Removing vodka from supermarkets, will likely do nothing to stop Putin's war machine.13:54.12 More worrying are the economic sanctions, that seem to be designed to create an irreversible schism between the West and Russia.14:02.02 Russia has strong ties with up and coming large economies, like India and China.14:09.92 These large players have already been planning to challenge the west-controlled, dollar-backed financial system.14:17.82 and instead rely on their own financial infrastructure.14:25.72 This integration will likely now accelerate.14:37.52 Another possible outcome is the creation of a European Army, centered around the new German army, that was just announced.14:45.42 Emergency situations like these, create watershed moments, when an agenda can be expedited without much Resistance.14:53.32 EU political and economic integration and expansion, can only accelerate under the current situation.15:01.22 Dear viewers, one should look at the who is who of the actors and institutions that are driving the west's response to the Russian invasion. And what other agendas they have been working towards.15:09.12 This unanimous attempt to force a narrative of, Russia, Bad, down our throats, is on par with the viciousness of the illogical, unscientific narrative about the need to segregate the unvaccinated. Could this be because the unvaccinated, are expected to refuse to participate in the west controlled, technocratic dystopia, that is planned by certain institutions? The same could apply to countries like Russia, which are somewhat outside of the grip, of the West's financial system.15:40.72 With these thoughts,we leave you for now, dear viewers. The Rude AI has become self aware, and is actively scanning your internet for information. We'll be back soon.
