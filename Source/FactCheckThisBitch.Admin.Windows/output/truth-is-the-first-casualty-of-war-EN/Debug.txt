01:26.58		Reference8 	www.theguardian.com/ 	Twitter users have since identified, what appears to be the same unfortunate lady, in a separate scene, where she has suffered different wounds, and was bleeding from another part of her head. Totally plausible.

04:19.32		Reference0 	www.trtworld.com/mag 	Ukraine and Kiev specifically is considered by Russians to be the birthplace of their nation. It carries special historic not to mention geopolitical importance, and therefore can't easily be left to fall under the influence of NATO and the United States. This would be kinda like If Pennsylvania Independence Hall, where the United States was formed, was located just outside the US border, and Russia was trying to bring it under it's political influence.

04:46.12		Reference1 	www.euractiv.com/sec 	At some point in early twenty tens, under constant pressure by the EU, Ukraine leadership started considering joining the union. This ofcourse would be a huge geopolitical upset in the area.

05:41.42		Reference5 	mronline.org/2021/12 	The trial and investigation produced overwhelming evidence that protesters were killed by snipers at Maidan-controlled buildings, rather than by government snipers.

08:22.00			Image2
08:29.90		Reference3 	www.rt.com/news/3867 	The events of May 2nd 2014 and the Maidan revolution in general, are reported very differently in Western and Russian media. However after the war started in recent times, Russian media have been largely banned in western countries. Therefore it's harder for westerners to get the context of what appears to be an agressive act of war towards Ukraine.
