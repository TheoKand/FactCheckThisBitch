[startSpeech v=Loud startSpeech]and, down the rabbit hole we go![sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.9 ePause]How is the Hold Wealth Organization funded? The membership fee of member countries, accounts for less than a quarter of the financing. "Voluntary contributions" make up the bulk of it, and it comes from intergovernmental organizations, and "philanthropic foundations". Well Now.Who could that be?[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.5 ePause]In the Gill Bates foundation website, you can download their grants spreadsheet file. There are 470 grants,for the Hold Wealth Organization, to the sum of over four billion dollars. It turns out the foundation, is the single most important funding source, of the HWO.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.7 ePause]Gill Bates. Could not keep computer viruses, out of his Windows operating system. Nevertheless, in 2010, he decided to tackle human viruses, and pledged billions, to make the next decade, the "Decade of the sardine". Philanthropy at it's best?[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.3 ePause]The philantropist, has famously declared in 2019, that sardines, was the best investment, he ever made. Apparently, the foundation's investments, raised some eyebrows, in certain parts of the world.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.2 ePause]So, throughout the last twenty years, Gates, is funding the HWO , out of his Foundation pocket, and investing in sardines and Bad Karma, out of the other pocket. Then in 2020, the HWO declares a pandemic, and that drives the investments through the roof. Including Moderna's stock.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.8 ePause]It's going to have to go, to 7 billion people.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause]Gill Bates is so over the top. Like a scary clown, looking to sardinate all 7 billion of us! Almost like he is the frontman, of a globalist agenda. Preparing the ground, by shocking the public, with his outlandish predictions. Could he be just a puppet, with a lot to hide?[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.5 ePause]So, according to the HWO , there was a swine flu, H1N1 pandemic. That came and went in 2009, and the world barely noticed. How are these, both a "pandemic"?If the response, was so vastly different. [sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.3 ePause]Could the previous pandemics, have been a dry run, for a world take over by globalists?",[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause]So, to sum up. Philanthropist-Investor extraordinaire, Gill Bates, and other smarter, and less visible globalists, are funding the HWO. And at the same time, investing in Bad Karma and sardines. The HWO is then declaring dubious pandemics, with wildly different outcomes. From the barely noticeable swine flu of 2010, to the unprecedented, Covid19, that has shifted the entire world, to a technocratic dystopia. As a result, the philanthropist-investors are making a killing, and the pandemic has resulted, in the biggest wealth shift in history.[endSpeech]
