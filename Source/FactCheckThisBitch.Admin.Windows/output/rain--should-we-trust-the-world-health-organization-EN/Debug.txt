00:05.88		Reference0 	www.who.int/about/fu 	How is the World Health Organization funded? The membership fee of member countries, accounts for less than a quarter of the financing. "Voluntary contributions" make up the bulk of it, and it comes from intergovernmental organizations, and "philanthropic foundations". Well Now.who could that be?

01:40.42	Piece 4 Does the great philanthropist have any other ties with the vaccine industry?
01:46.30		Reference0 	www.wsj.com/articles 	So, throughout the last twenty years, Gates, is funding the WHO , out of his Foundation pocket, and investing in vaccines and Big Pharma, out of the other pocket. Then in 2020, the WHO declares a pandemic, and that drives the investments through the roof. Including Moderna's stock.

Preparing the ground, by shocking the public, with his outlandish predictions. Could he be just a puppet, with a lot to hide?

03:02.66	Piece 7 Has the WHO declared any other pandemics the last few years?
03:08.54		Reference0 	www.forbes.com/2010/ 	So, according to the WHO , there was a swine flu, H1N1 pandemic. That came and went in 2009, and the world barely noticed. How are these, both a "pandemic"?If the response, was so vastly different. Could the previous pandemics, have been a dry run, for a world take over by globalists?

03:34.24	Piece 8 Has anyone benefited financially from all the deadly pandemics?
03:40.12		Reference0 	www.dailymail.co.uk/ 	So, to sum up. Philanthropist-Investor extraordinaire, Bill Gates, and other smarter, and less visible globalists, are funding the WHO. And at the same time, investing in Big Pharma and vaccines. The WHO is then declaring dubious pandemics, with wildly different outcomes. From the barely noticeable swine flu of 2010, to the unprecedented, Covid19, that has shifted the entire world, to a technocratic dystopia. As a result, the philanthropist-investors are making a killing, and the pandemic has resulted, in the biggest wealth shift in history. Nothing to see here, dear mainstream media watchers. Move along.
