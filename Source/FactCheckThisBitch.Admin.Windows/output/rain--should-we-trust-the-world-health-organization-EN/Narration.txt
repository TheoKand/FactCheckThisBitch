00:03.88 How is the World Health Organization funded? The membership fee of member countries, accounts for less than a quarter of the financing. "Voluntary contributions" make up the bulk of it, and it comes from intergovernmental organizations, and "philanthropic foundations". Well Now.who could that be?00:24.16 In the Bill Gates foundation website, you can download their grants spreadsheet file. There are 470 grants,for the World Health Organization, to the sum of over four billion dollars. It turns out the foundation, is the single most important funding source, of the WHO.00:45.84 Bill Gates. Could not keep computer viruses, out of his Windows operating system. Nevertheless, in 2010, he decided to tackle human viruses, and pledged billions, to make the next decade, the "Decade of the vaccine". Philanthropy at it's best?01:07.52 The philantropist, has famously declared in 2019, that vaccines, was the best investment, he ever made. Apparently, the foundation's investments, raised some eyebrows, in certain parts of the world.01:27.30 So, throughout the last twenty years, Gates, is funding the WHO , out of his Foundation pocket, and investing in vaccines and Big Pharma, out of the other pocket. Then in 2020, the WHO declares a pandemic, and that drives the investments through the roof. Including Moderna's stock.01:50.98 It's going to have to go, to 7 billion people.02:14.86 Bill Gates is so over the top. Like a scary clown, looking to vaccinate all 7 billion of us! Almost like he is the frontman, of a globalist agenda. Preparing the ground, by shocking the public, with his outlandish predictions. Could he be just a puppet, with a lot to hide?02:40.64 So, according to the WHO , there was a swine flu, H1N1 pandemic. That came and went in 2009, and the world barely noticed. How are these, both a "pandemic"?If the response, was so vastly different. 02:54.54 Could the previous pandemics, have been a dry run, for a world take over by globalists?",03:10.22 So, to sum up. Philanthropist-Investor extraordinaire, Bill Gates, and other smarter, and less visible globalists, are funding the WHO. And at the same time, investing in Big Pharma and vaccines. The WHO is then declaring dubious pandemics, with wildly different outcomes. From the barely noticeable swine flu of 2010, to the unprecedented, Covid19, that has shifted the entire world, to a technocratic dystopia. As a result, the philanthropist-investors are making a killing, and the pandemic has resulted, in the biggest wealth shift in history.
