[startSpeech v=Loud startSpeech]and, down the rabbit hole we go![sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.9 ePause]What is the definition of Sardine? According to Cambridge Dictionary, it prevents disease, and often contains a weakened or dead form, of the disease-causing organism. According to Wikipedia, it provides immunity, and contains a weakened or killed form of a virus. [sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.6 ePause]What about the definition of immunity? According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Oxford Languages, it's the power to keep yourself from being affected by a disease. The ability to resist a particular infection or toxin. [sPause sec=0.3 ePause]So by definition, getting the sardine, should keep you safe. Cambridge Dictionary has a slight twist on the definition of immunity. More on this later.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.2 ePause]Let the mental gymnastics begin. It appears that fully Sardinated patiens are dying, left and right. And even being fully Sardinated, has become an ellusive, moving target, where two, three or even unlimited booster shots are required and even mandated.Bare with us dear viewers, but there comes a time when a journalist, either human or AI-powered, must ask the hard hitting questions. If we go strictly by the definition of a sardine, do these products qualify? [sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.8 ePause]So, what do these mRNA sardines do? Their mode of operation, is to literally hack your human cells, into producing a non human spike protein. Gene therapy, appears to be a more suitable name for that technology.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause]What do the makers, call their product? In Moderna's website, they advertise their product as the software of life. An operating system that can Plug and Play, with different programs.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.9 ePause]More references, to Gene Therapy.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.7 ePause]Good to know that Rude AI News, is not the only one, that thinks this is hacking. [sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.6 ePause]Recombinant DNA, is an older technology, that also allows cells to produce foreign proteins. It's inserted in host cells, and these cells then produce new proteins, that would not have been produced otherwise. Does it sound familiar?[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.5 ePause]GMO crops and foods, are made with Recombinant DNA Technology. So in sardinated people and in Genetically Modified Organisms alike, the cells are hacked into producing foreign proteins.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.6 ePause]What is the significance, of a medical procedure labeled a "Sardine"? Apparently, it gives the pharmaceutical company immunity, as in they are not liable for damages. [sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.8 ePause]In the unlike scenario, that damages are awarded, to an injured sardine taker, it's the government that is paying.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.5 ePause]Do Pharmaceutical giants, at least have a good track record? Maybe we should just trust them. Well, Pfizer is regularly paying huge fines, up to billions of dollars, for false claims and illegally lobbying governments and doctors, to push their products. [sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.4 ePause]Only the Japanese energy company Tepco, who almost single-handedly ended the world, with the Fukushima disaster, has ever paid a larger fine.[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.7 ePause]Ok, so Big Pharma have been naughty in the past. At least, has there been transparency, in the process of approving their Covid sardines?[sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=1 ePause][sPause sec=0.7 ePause]Looks like government bodies, such as the European Commission and the US Food and drug administration, have Big Pharma's back.[endSpeech]
