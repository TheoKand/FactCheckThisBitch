Code TODO:

-Complete obfuscation: shorten links in description
-after adding RenderOrder, the Index is obsolete. It should be just the order of the item in the array that changes
 when you drag around

Later
-add boolean field in piece to control if thesis is rendered after the references
-don't allow save data if validation fails
